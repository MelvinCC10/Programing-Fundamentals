The purpose of this lab is to gain practice using variables for file input, processing, and file output.

Your friend is interested in knowing if his favorite movies were box office successes. He gives you a file, and needs you to write a file labeling the movie title, budget, gross, and profit for each movie. File is attached here: input_file.txt

# Constraints
Do not use any concepts beyond the current chapter, unless explicitly stated in the tasks below

# Task 1: Setup Variables
1. Add your input text file to the resource files folder
2. Add yor output text file to the resource files folder
3. Use preprocessor directives to include input/output, file input/output, string variables, and input/output manipulation.
4. Declare the input file variable you will use inplace of cin for file input.
5. Declare the output file variable you will use inplace of cout for file output.
6. Declare variables to contain movie titles, of type string
7. Declare variables to contain budget and gross, of type double
8. Declare variables to contain net profit, of type double
9. Separate Task 1 from Task 2 by pressing ENTER on your keyboard. This provides a single line of whitespace in your code

# Task 2: Input Data
1. Use the variable in Task 1.4 to open the text file in Task 1.1
2. Use the variable in Task 1.5 to open the text file in Task 1.2
3. Use the variable in Task 1.4 to populate variables from Task 1.6 and 1.7
4. Separate Task 2 from Task 3 by pressing ENTER on your keyboard. This provides a single line of whitespace in your code

# Task 3: Process Data
1. Use the variables from Task 1.7 to populate the variable from Task 1.8.
2. Separate Task 3 from Task 4 by pressing ENTER on your keyboard. This provides a single line of whitespace in your code

# Task 4: Output Data
1. Use the variable from Task 1.5 to output to a file.
2. Each variable from Task 1.6, Task 1.7, and Task 1.8 should be preceded by a label. "Movie Title: ", etc. Every row after "Movie Title: " should be written to a next line. See sample output

# Task 5: Cleanup
1. Close the connection from the variable in Task 1.4.
2. Close the connection from the variable in Task 1.5.
